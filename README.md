## ðŸš€ Quick start:

1.  install node modules (all the dependencies)

    ```sh
      npm install
    ```
    
2. Create your Webpack production build by running:

    ```sh
      npm run build
    ```
    
    Run the application server with :
     ```sh
       npm start
    ```
    
    
3. You can view the React application on localhost:8080

    ```sh
      http://localhost:8080
    ```


PS. 
1. /proxy server is not working, for backend just 
        run npm start
2. for frontend delete "start" command from JSON manifest file and add
 "start": "webpack-dev-server --open",
    "nodemon": "nodemon ./server/index.js"
    
I NEED TO RUN(BUILD) WEBPACK FIRST AND START THE SERVER
